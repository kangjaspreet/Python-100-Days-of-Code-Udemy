# Day 1 Project - Band Name Generator

# Ask a user what city he or she was raised in, and what his or her pet's name is. Concatenate the two user inputs to form a band name.

print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator!\n")

input_city_raised = input("What city did you grow up in?\n")

input_pet_name = input("What is your pet's name?\n")

print("Your band name could be " + input_city_raised + " " + input_pet_name)
